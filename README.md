## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

Using VisualCodeStudio!


### What I learned

This project helped me a great deal with reinforcing my understanding of both Flexbox and positioning elements on a page.

### Continued development

I plan to continue getting more and more comfortable with Flexbox, as this is still an area I struggle with. I understand the basic concepts but still need to do quite a bit of Googling to get what I want, which adds  a lot of time to my workflow. With more practice, I hope to become more confident and not need to look things up as frequently.
